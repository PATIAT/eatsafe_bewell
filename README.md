# Eat Safe - Be Well, a website designed to record and document food safety and quality incidents experienced by consumers.

## Milestone Project 3 - Backend Development

<h2 align="center"><img src=""></h2>

* Eat Safe - Be well is a website which allows consumers of everyday food items to report, record and document food safety and quality incidents. Incidents may relate to the safety or quality of food including food borne illnesses, the discovery of foreign object or allergic reactions. The website is designed to be fully responsive so that it can be used on any device.

* This is my Milestone Project 3 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website uses non-relational databases, features full CRUD functionality and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

# User Experience

## User stoires

### First-time Users

*The website users that fall into this category are considering reporting a food safety incident online for the first time.* 

* As a first-time user, I want the landing page of the website to clearly explain the purpose of the website .

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to easily register for an account.

* As a first-time user, I want the website to work on any device.

### Returning Users

*The website users that fall into this category are have previously reported a food safety incident online.* 

* As a returning user, I want to be able to log in to my account.

* As a returning user, I want to be able to create / view / edit / delete my own food safety incident reports.

* As a returning user, I want to be able to view other userâ€™s food safety incident reports.

* As a returning user, I want there to be valid corrective actions that I am able to take based upon my food safety incident report. This may include links to reporting mechanisms which alert potentially unsafe foods to the relevant authorities.

* As a returning user, I want to be able to search for food safety incident reports, to make it quicker to find incidents with a certain word in their name or description.

* As a returning user, I want to be able to access and use the website on any device.

### Buisness Owner

* As the website owner, I want users to be able to create, edit and delete their own reports, but not those of any other users.

* As the website owner, I want the adding, editing and deletion of any of the food safety incident categories to be restricted to users with admin privileges.

* As the business owner, I want it to be as easy as possible for users to submit food safety incident reports. E.g. a simple and quick process while gathering enough meaningful information to be useful to other users.

* As the business owner, I want the website to be effective and look consistently good on any device.

## Design

### Overview

- The website design is professional, yet attractive. The name Eat Safe - Be Well refers to the importance of food safety and food quality. These two food attributes should be a prerequisite for all food that is on sale to consumers. Where this is not found to be the case, a mechanism must exist where consumers can report any such issues, thereby alerting fellow consumers and relevant authorities to potentially unsafe food.
