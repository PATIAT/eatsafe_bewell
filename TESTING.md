- In instances where performance was marked down, it was due to the following:

  - Eliminate render-blocking resources
  - Reduce unused JavaScript
  - Preload Largest Contentful Paint image
  - Reduce unused CSS

- In future all of these suggestions will be considered during development.

- In instances where accessibility was marked down, it was due to the following:

  - Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
  - Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order.
  - Form elements do not have associated labels (this is where the category dropdown is used but is not an input/label)
  
- In future, lighthouse could be used to identify these types of issues earlier in the development process.

# Testing User Stories

### First-time Users

* As a first-time user, I want the landing page of the website to clearly explain the purpose of the website .
    - The landing page has a clear message of the purpose of the website with a call to action which is prominant. 

* As a first-time user, I want to be able to easily register for an account.
    - The main call to action is to register, there is also an option for this on the navbar.

    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-home-page.png" width="800"></h2>

* As a first-time user, I want the website to work on any device.
    - The website is fully responsive on all device sizes as demonstrated by this testing.

    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-home-page-mobile.png" height="800" width="400"></h2>

### Returning Users

* As a returning user, I want to be able to log in to my account.
    - There is a prominant log in option on the navbar which is easy to see and use.

    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-home-page.png" width="00"></h2>
    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-home-page-navbar-mobile.png" height="800" width="400"></h2>

* As a returning user, I want to be able to create / view / edit / delete my own food safety incident reports.
    - Once logged in, users can create new reports, view theirs and other user's reports, edit their own reports only and delete their own reports only.

    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-add-report-page.png" width="800"></h2>

* As a returning user, I want to be able to view other userâ€™s food safety incident reports.
    - On the main home page, reports from all user accounts are displayed but the edit and delete buttons appear for only the users own reports.

    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-all-reports.png" width="800"></h2>

* As a returning user, I want there to be valid corrective actions that I am able to take based upon my food safety incident report. This may include links to reporting mechanisms which alert potentially unsafe foods to the relevant authorities.
    - This has not been acheived, primarily down to workload and deadline concerns.

* As a returning user, I want to be able to search for food safety incident reports, to make it quicker to find incidents with a certain word in their name or description.
    - The main homepage features a search function whereby the users can use text to search the report name and description.
    
    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-search-bar.png" width="800"></h2>
    
* As a returning user, I want to be able to access and use the website on any device.
    - The website is responsive and works well on all device screen sizes.

    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-tablet-screen.png" width="800"></h2>

### Buisness Owner

<h2 align="left"><img src="" width="800"></h2>

* As the website owner, I want users to be able to create, edit and delete their own reports, but not those of any other users.
    - This is acheivable for users once they have registered, they have full CRUD functionality.

    <h2 align="left"><img src="static/testing/images/testing-add-report-page.png" width="800"></h2>

* As the website owner, I want the adding, editing and deletion of any of the food safety incident categories to be restricted to users with admin privileges.
    - Only admin users can add, edit or delete categories. This is facilitated by verifying that the user is "admin" before allowing access to these pages.

* As the business owner, I want it to be as easy as possible for users to submit food safety incident reports. E.g. a simple and quick process while gathering enough meaningful information to be useful to other users.
    - The form to submit and edit reports are as simplistic as possible with a clean aesthetic to facilitate easy use.

* As the business owner, I want the website to be effective and look consistently good on any device.
    - The design and colour scheme are consistent throughout the site. Additionally a lot of the same elements were re-used and re-styled e.g. cards.

# Automated Testing

- I have not included automated testing as part of this project but intend to use it in Module 4.

# Peer Review

- In the final stages of the project, I submitted the site for Peer Review by fellow students and alumni at Code Institute via Slack.

- Comments were left by fellow students that stated the website looked good, the readme looked good and that they had noticed some accessibility issues with colour contrast tool Wave whereby some of the white text on green background was not at the required contrast ratio. As mentioned above, in future projects I intend to use lighthouse and other tools such as wave throughout the development process. This is so it is not as onerous to make changes if issues like this exist.

- Further comments were left by fellow students and included the following:
    - Overall feedback: Nice idea, as a user it functions very well. Very clear from the moment you enter the site what it is about. I didn't manage to break anything, just a few UX things mentioned that might need to be tweaked. Typing in the the best before date box didn't ruin my UX, I just worry if it breaks something in the backend, which then breaks the site.
    - The password field has a specific format but the format itself is not communicated to the user.
        - This issue was fixed by adding a placeholder to the form field.
    - The best before date field on the add report form is a type="text" rather than type="date" so the data is being sent to the database as a string.
        - This was left as it was due to the fact that type="text" for a date format like "06 April, 2023" is not supported by the type="date" attribute. The type="date" attribute is designed to accept date values in the ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). This format was adopted due to its use in the CI Task Manager project.
    - 404 pages takes you to register and not reports as it suggests on the button on the page.
        - This issue was fixed by updating the links and text so they matched. So now, for logged in users, it states "Home" and goes to the get_reports page and for logged out users it states "Register" and goes to the register page.

# Bugs

## Resolved

- Issue: 
    - base.html - brand logo <i> overlapping text on small screens.
- Fix: 
    - added code to remove <i> on smaller screens only using MCSS.

- Issue: 
    - run.py - function only showed the users username and no other info on page as per CI project.
- Fix: 
    - updated dashboard() function to look up session user's reports so they can be displayed to their own dashboard.

- Issue: 
    - dashboard.html and reports.html - buttons were overlapping on small screen sizes only.
- Fix: 
    - used the MCSS class btn-flat which resolved the issue.

- Issue: 
    - during the mid-point project call, my Tutor suggested amending the background colour to an off-white to allow the cards to be more visible. 
- Fix: 
    - This was adopted and rather than rgba(255, 255, 255, 1), rgba(217, 214, 210, 0.35) was used.

- Issue: 
    - When logged out I attempted to access the get_categories page where the admin user only should be allowed to add, edit or delete categories. I was able to access the page while logged out by overwriting the URL.
- Fix: 
    - In run.py, I added an is_admin function which checks whether a user has admin permissions. This was then used to check if a user has admin as their username when trying to access the get_categories page. If they do not, a flash message appears to tell them only admin users can access this section of the website

- Issue:
    - It was possible to access the add_report page when not logged in but reports cannot be submitted to the database. 
    - It was possible to access the delete_report page when not logged in provided the report id is available to a logged out user which is unlikely.
    - It was possible to access the edit_report page when not logged in provided the report id is available to a logged out user which is unlikely. 
- Fix: 
    - Updated functions in run.py to check whether users are either logged in and if not, they are redirected to the login page or whether a user is the user that reported the report and if not, they too are either redirected to the login page or reports page.

## Unresolved

- It is still possible for admin users to add cetegories with identical names.
- When trying to access an edit category page or delete category while not logged in as admin and by pasting the URL with the category id into the search bar, I receive an ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS error which is usually caused by an infinite loop of redirects. In this case, the cause of the error might be the redirect("get_reports") call inside the first conditional block of the edit_category() function. If the user is not an admin, the function redirects them to the "get_reports". However, if "get_reports" requires admin privileges and the user is not an admin, the function will redirect them again to the "get_reports", creating an infinite loop of redirects. To fix the error, I checked if the user has admin privileges before redirecting them to the "get_reports" (they didn't), and checked if the "get_reports" is accessible to non-admin users (it is). I also tried to redirect the user to a different endpoint and render a different template if they weren't not an admin, to avoid an infinite loop of redirects. None of the above has worked effectively but I beleive that this scenario is unlikely as a user will need to know the category id to be able to replicate these circumstances and without admin access, this is not possible.
- When a category is deleted, the reports associated with that category remain in place. In future, I intend to implement cascade functionality whereby when a category is deleted, all associated reports are deleted. This was simply an oversight during this project.
